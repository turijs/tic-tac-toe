# Tic Tac Toe (built in 2016)

# Description
This was my first foray into writing game-playing AIs. tic-tac-toe was a good introduction, since it is such a simple game. This program uses the minimax algorithm to play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe. It is not possible to defeat it. Features include the ability to play as X, O, or both (solo play). It also has an "undo" move feature.
